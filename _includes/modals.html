                Work in Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) and Participatory GIS (PGIS) has for many years emphasized the need for deep community engagement as an aspect of quantitative spatial analysis. The incrasing ubiquity of big data, volunteered geographic informaiton (VGI), open data and software and mobile and web based IGS sytems has significantly shaped these efforts, allowing for new forms of collaboration and community based data collection. With increased use of VGI data from social media and similiar sources, however, non-academics may also become increasingly marginalized within the research process.

                In this session, we discuss the future of participatory spatial analysis, one that creatively makes use of new and emerging forms of data collection, analysis, and distribution or finds new uses for traditional methods. Presenters are engaged in work that substantively engages with groups outside the academy--local/regional governments, non-profits, neighborhood organizations, or other similar actors.

            The popularity and prevalence of mobile devices have brought seemingly endless opportunities to deliver and collect location-based information to a mobile population. This paradigm shift has brought new opportunities to improve and build upon efforts related to Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) research and applications. Challenges posed by disasters are one such problem that could benefit from improved PPGIS. There are multiple phases of disaster including mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and resilience. Each phase requires different data, inviting citizen engagement within a participatory GIS. Multiple parties rely on data related to disasters to help to prepare and respond to an event. These parties include individuals from the community, private sector, government agencies,  and researchers. Each actor has informational or data needs when passing through various phases of a disaster. Mobile devices and distributed systems present opportunities to collect relevant disaster data in which citizen (could) share their local knowledge in through PPGIS initiatives. Papers presented in this session cover topics pertaining to PPGIS data collection and disaster.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <div class="event-description">
                Past work in critical pedagogy, participatory action research, and political ecology has emphasized the need for research that draws upon and develops existing expertise within communities, critiquing top down models rooted in researchers' own questions, expertise, and positionalities. In practice, however, community groups often look to academics for guidance for both the tchincal aspects of research design and the best ways to frame and interpret research results. With limited time and fincancial resources, groups may expect academics to take charge, providing structure and direction that expedites the research process. This panel session will focus on a discussion of how to navigate community expectations, the role of researchers' own expertise, and a commitment to participatory research. Questions that shape the discussion include:
                </br>
                In what ways do you provide theoretical or methodological input to the communities you work with, and what factors shape the ways you do so?
                </br>
                What kinds of "expertise" do they hope you can provide? How have you responded to those requests?
                </br>
                Communities may look to academics for both substantive expertise--knowledge about a particular issue or experience working within certain theoretical frameworks--or for technical asistnace with research design and implementation. As a researcher, are you more inlicned to provide input with one of these over the other?
                </br>
                How does your own insider/outsider status (with regards to race/class/gender/regional/etc. identities) with communities shape the kinds of input you feel comfortable providing or the ways you speak with/for them?
                </br>
                Can you share a time you now wish you had played a more active role at shaping a community research project--when your perspective or experience could have been helpful? Or conversely, a time when you now think you were too active?

            OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most widely used open geospatial database that is based on volunteered geographic information (VGI). OSM's success and worldwide content attracts a range of different public, private sector and governmental actors. Many projects focus on the humanitarian and development community, environmental and transportation sector, environmental justice, community mapping, and international education. The OSM platform serves successfully as a link between the activities and interests of the academic community, NGOs, private sector, along with public needs. This paper session is part of a set of activities under the banner of the 2017 Mapathon@AAG event, co-organized by MapGive, an initiative of the U.S. Department of State, YouthMappers, a program supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and George Mason University. OSM has grown over the past 10 years and the resulting open, crowdsourced database has been utilized in many projects and applications. Thus this session will facilitate a scientific discussion between researchers and practitioners that are actively involved in OSM activities.
